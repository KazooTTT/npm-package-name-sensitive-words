# npm-package-name-sensitive-words
Record some sensitive words in npm package names to avoid publishing failures (continuously updated)

# Why create this repository?
One day I found that the reason why I failed to publish the npm package was just because the name of my package had the word `download` (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/6090
), so I wanted to collect sensitive words related to the npm package to avoid wasting too much time on it, and to provide you with some reference.
